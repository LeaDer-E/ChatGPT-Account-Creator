# OpenAI Account Bypass

#### While this program can't create accounts for you, it can help you bypass certain restrictions on websites. If you live in a country where OpenAI is banned, you can enter any phone number and type "Start()" wit Capital "S" in Python Shell to run the program. With a bit of luck, your account will be created in under 24 hours. However, please note that this method is typically used as a last resort for those who can't obtain an external phone number.
#### There are other programs and websites you can use to get a phone number for another country, and you can even purchase some programs as well. Keep in mind that this particular method can be time-consuming, so it's best to exhaust all other options before resorting to it. But rest assured, if you do need to use this method, the video explanation is easy to follow and should provide all the information you need.
