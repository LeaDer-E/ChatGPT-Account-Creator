# OpenAI Account Bypass

#### While this program can't create accounts for you, it can help you bypass certain restrictions on websites. If you live in a country where OpenAI is banned, you can enter any phone number and type `Start()` wit Capital `S` in Python Shell to run the program. With a bit of luck, your account will be created in under 24 hours. However, please note that this method is typically used as a last resort for those who can't obtain an external phone number.
#### There are other programs and websites you can use to get a phone number for another country, and you can even purchase some programs as well. Keep in mind that this particular method can be time-consuming, so it's best to exhaust all other options before resorting to it. But rest assured, if you do need to use this method, the video explanation is easy to follow and should provide all the information you need.

## Alternative Solutions:
#### There are several ways to create an account, including using an application to receive messages from a number outside the blocked countries or using a website to receive messages. You can also use "[PEO][PEO]" from [Quora][Quora], which is the best solution for you. However, if you do not want any of these options, you can use my tools.

## Dependencies:
#### To install the dependencies required for this Python script, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Here are the steps:
- Install the latest version of pip, if you haven't already done so.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
- Run the following command to install the required packages:
  ```bash 
    pip install selenium undetected-chromedriver
  ```
#### This will install the Selenium and  undetected-chromedriver packages, which are used by the script. Once the installation is complete, you can run the script.

## Usage:
- Ensure that the dependencies are installed.
- Set the starting number in the `start_num` variable, #Recomended to be `0` as is.
- Run the script.

#### The script will automate the process of entering numbers starting from the specified `start_num` into an input field on the web page. The script will try to enter each number three times, with a pause of `0.4` seconds between each attempt. If all three attempts fail, Well Wait `1` Second, and try.

#### Note that the script uses a headless Chrome browser to run the automation process, and disables image loading to improve performance. You can modify these settings in the `options` object if necessary. (not recomended)

## Disclaimer:
#### This script is for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk. The script may violate the terms of service of the web page being automated, and may result in your IP address being blocked or other legal consequences. Please use responsibly.

## Speed and Duration:
* Entry Speed: 125 ~ 150 Number per minute.
* Numbers per hour: 7500 ~ 9000.
* Numbers per day: 180,000 ~ 215,000.
* It would take approximately 110 hours to enter 999,999 Numbers.
* It would take approximately 4.5 days to enter 999,999 Numbers continuously for 24 hours.

#### the expected completion time, it depends on various factors such as the speed of the computer running the code, the stability of the internet connection, and the responsiveness of the web page being interacted with. It's hard to provide an exact estimate.
the code is looping through one million numbers and entering them into the input field with a delay of 0.4 seconds between each attempt, it could potentially take several hours to complete.

#### If you're lucky, it will be finished in less than ten hours. If not, it might take around 4 and a half days at most, but not more than that. Don't worry, often the first digit from the left is 0 or 1, which means you have a good chance of finishing what you want before 22 hours. 
#### God was with you in your patience and waiting.
### Remember ðŸŒ¹:
#### I told you this is the last solution for you, but don't worry, it's a viable and effective solution with a success rate of 100%.
### Notice!
#### The above statistics are based on the capabilities of my device and internet speed. I don't know if the situation will be worse or not for you, but I think it won't improve because that's the maximum speed the program can work with on the ChatGPT website.

## simple hint
To clarify, if you see a blue message in the shell, it means that the code failed to enter the verification box. However, I assure you that you will never have to face this problem. I simply wanted to inform you in case you do encounter it in the future. :)

## Known Issues
Any issues are usually because the underlying browser automation framework has a
bug or inconsistency. Where possible, we try to cover up these underlying
problems in the client, but sometimes workarounds require higher-level
intervention.
try to restart the code or change the vedio link

expected.
