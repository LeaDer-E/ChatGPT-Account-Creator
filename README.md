This is a Python script that automates the process of entering a sequence of numbers into an input field on the chat.openai.com website.

The script uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the website and Undetected Chromedriver to prevent detection by the website's bot detection mechanisms.

To use the script, make sure to install the required dependencies:

Selenium (pip install selenium)
Undetected Chromedriver (pip install undetected-chromedriver)
To run the script, simply execute the Python file. The script will start by opening the chat.openai.com website and locating the input field. It will then enter a sequence of numbers, starting from the specified starting number (which can be changed by modifying the start_num variable), and attempt to submit each number.

If an error occurs, the script will retry entering the number up to three times before moving on to the next number. If all attempts fail, an error message will be printed to the console.

Note that the script is set to run in headless mode (without a visible browser window) and disables image loading to reduce resource usage and speed up the process.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs. Enjoy!
